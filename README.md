uisites

We are expecting our students to have a basic knowlege of:

- calculus, especially matrix calculus, differentiation
- linear algebra
- probability theory and statistics
- programming, especially on Python

Although if you don't have any of this, you could substitude it with your
diligence because the course provides additional materials to study requirements
yourself.

## Materials for self-study

A lot of great materials are available online. See
[extra materials](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-course/blob/master/extra_materials.md) file for the whole list. Also lectures and
seminars contains references to more detailed materials on topics.
